# Nerps-XP

An Add-On Module for Foundry VTT to auto-calculate Pathfinder 2E encounter XP based on the PC's, NPC's, & Hazards you add to the encounter.

![Demo](demo/Nerps-XP-Demo.mp4)

##Shout Out!
This module was clearly inspired by [Monk's Little Details](https://github.com/ironmonk88/monks-little-details) module and some code/css shamelessly borrowed as a basis for this module!

## Future Plans
Not a lot of features are planned for this module. It only needs to do one thing and that is assist the GM with building/scaling an encounter.

 * Adding a post-encounter XP chat card or dialog or "something" when you end combat to let the GM easily hand out the XP.
 * Stretch Goal: Add the XP a given creature would add to an encounter or does add to an encounter "somewhere". Most likely on the combat tracker itself.

## Changelog
 * v1.0.0 - Initial Release!
